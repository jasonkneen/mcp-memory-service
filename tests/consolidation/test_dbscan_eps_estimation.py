"""
Regression tests for DBSCAN eps estimation (chaining fix, upstream issue
observed in production: 989/1104 memories collapsed into a single cluster
with coherence 0.461).

The old `_dbscan_clustering` derived eps purely from dataset size
(`0.5 - n/10000`, clamped to [0.2, 0.7]) with no reference to the actual
similarity distribution of the embeddings being clustered. Some
sentence-embedding models (e.g. the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 default) produce a
narrow, elevated baseline cosine similarity across unrelated content, so that
size-only eps let DBSCAN's density-reachability chain unrelated memories
into one giant cluster.

These tests exercise `_estimate_eps` directly. It uses
`sklearn.neighbors.NearestNeighbors` internally for the k-distance lookup
(replacing an earlier full n x n distance matrix, which was O(n^2) memory
and time -- flagged in review), so scikit-learn is required to run these
tests. Chaining verification itself uses a from-scratch connected-components
check rather than DBSCAN, so no additional dependency is needed for that
part.
