"""Interface-conformance guard for the storage contract the web API relies on.

Two guards live here, both added after a backend silently drifted from what its
callers assume.

Part one, the `store` keyword (issue #133), described below. Part two, the set
of methods the web API calls on `storage` without a `hasattr` guard (issue
#213): Milvus never implemented `get_all_tags_with_counts`, so the unguarded
call in web/api/memories.py::get_tags raised AttributeError, which that handler
converts into HTTP 501 — the error the Browse tab showed. The `store` guard
could not catch it: it only compares signatures of methods that exist.

Part one — the multi-store `store` parameter (issue #133).

The multi-store partition key (commit 53745ac0, #57 Phase 1) added a `store`
keyword argument to a set of storage methods and to every call site in the
service/handler layer. Python does not check that each backend's override kept
its signature in sync, so the Milvus backend shipped with `count_all_memories`,
`search_memories`, and `store` still on the old signature -> `count_all_memories()
got an unexpected keyword argument 'store'` at runtime (issue #133).

This test is the practical equivalent of the compile-time check the reporter
asked for: it inspects each backend class (no live backend needed) and asserts
that every method in the multi-store contract accepts a `store` keyword, so the
signatures can never silently drift apart again.

Part two — methods the web API calls unguarded (issue #213).

Some `storage.<method>()` call sites in web/api/ are wrapped in
`if hasattr(storage, ...)` (or bail out early when it is missing), which makes
the method optional. The rest are not, which makes the method mandatory for
every backend the web server can be pointed at. WEB_API_REQUIRED_METHODS is that
second list: each entry must be declared on MemoryStorage and overridden by all
four backends, so a missing method fails here instead of on a dashboard tab.
