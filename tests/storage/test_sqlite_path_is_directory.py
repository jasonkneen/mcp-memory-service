A directory passed as the database path has to say so.

The published Docker images set MCP_MEMORY_SQLITE_PATH to the volume mount point,
which is a directory, and sqlite3 reports that as "unable to open database file".
That message reads like a permission or corruption problem and sends people
looking in the wrong place, so the container failure in #296 stayed unexplained.
