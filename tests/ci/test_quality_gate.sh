# Plain bash, same shape as test_pre_pr_check.sh (bats not available).
#
# The gate calls a model, so these tests do not run a full analysis pass. They
# cover the parts that decide whether the gate evaluates anything at all, plus
# the three defects that made the checks unable to report:
#
#   1. checks 1 and 2 looped over a pipe, so their subshell threw away exit_code
#      and the warnings array - neither check could fail the gate
#   2. `grep -c ... || echo 0` produced "0\n0" and killed the arithmetic test
#      in check 3 under set -e
#   3. the complexity pattern matched score 8, which the documented budget allows
#   4. complexity was scored per file, so a change to a file holding an unrelated
#      complex function failed the gate on proximity (#1118)
#   5. check 4 grepped for the word "breaking", which matches the model's own
#      "No breaking changes found."
#   6. the findings that set exit 1 were printed under "WARNINGS (non-blocking)"
