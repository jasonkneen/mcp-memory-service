# Test harness for the reporting behaviour of scripts/pr/pre_pr_check.sh
# Plain bash, same shape as test_check_versions.sh (bats not available).
#
# The gate itself runs the full suite and takes minutes, so these tests do not
# execute it. They cover the two reporting defects that made the gate unusable:
#
#   1. a failing test run aborted the script under `set -e` before its own
#      TEST_EXIT_CODE handling could report anything
#   2. a skipped quality gate (Gemini CLI absent) was reported as a pass
#
# Both are verified against the extracted logic rather than a full run.
