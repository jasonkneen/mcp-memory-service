    """Structural guard, not per-test discipline: any test anywhere under
    tests/unit/ that reaches lifecycle._kill_process without mocking it
    gets a loud AssertionError instead of a real signal -- this is the
    actual protection. To test _kill_process itself, re-patch it in that
    test; the raise-by-default here is just the fallback for everyone
    else. monkeypatch auto-restores it at teardown, so nothing leaks into
    later tests in the session. A no-op for tests that never touch the
    CLI lifecycle module.

    MCP_HTTP_PORT/HOST are also pinned away from this service's real
    default port (8000), covering the case where a test relies on
    launch's *default* port rather than passing --port explicitly (a
    test that passes --port 8000 directly bypasses this env entirely --
    _kill_process raising is what protects that case). This pin works
    despite mcp_memory_service.config.transport binding HTTP_PORT from
    MCP_HTTP_PORT at import time (before this fixture ever runs, and
    monkeypatch.setenv can't reach an already-bound module attribute) --
    lifecycle.py's own commands never read that cached value, they call
    os.environ.get("MCP_HTTP_PORT", "8000") directly at call time, which
    is exactly when this fixture's monkeypatch.setenv is in effect."""
