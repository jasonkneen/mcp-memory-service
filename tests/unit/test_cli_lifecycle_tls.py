Tests for TLS verification in the CLI's _probe_health health-check helper.

Regression guard: the health-check helper previously created an
ssl.SSLContext with check_hostname=False and verify_mode=ssl.CERT_NONE
unconditionally, for every HTTPS health check the `memory` CLI made
(launch/stop/restart/info/health), with no way to opt back in to real
verification. Same class of issue as discovery/client.py's
GHSA-x9r8-q2qj-cgvw fix.
