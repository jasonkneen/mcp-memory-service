Tests for the `memory status` embedding-health checks (issue #136).

`status` must not merely report storage stats and claim "healthy"; it has to
surface which embedding backend actually loaded, compare the model's output
dimension against the vec0 table's declared FLOAT[N], and (with --deep) prove a
memory can round-trip store→search→delete.

The status command loads the storage backend and (in the default path) a real
embedding model, and it reads its DB path from the ``config`` module which
caches ``SQLITE_VEC_PATH`` at import time. To keep these tests hermetic,
offline, and immune to config-caching across the wider suite, each case runs the
command in a fresh subprocess with its own temp DB and env — the same isolation
strategy used by tests/unit/test_cli_lazy.py.
