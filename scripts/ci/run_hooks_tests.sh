# Claude Code Hooks Test Runner
#
# Runs every *.test.js file under the repo's JS test directories -
# claude-hooks/tests and opencode/tests - and fails if any of them do.
#
# Until this existed, CI had no node steps at all: the three PR jobs were
# `pytest tests/`, a site/index.html version-string diff, and a release-only
# plugin manifest gate. None of them can observe a change to the hooks, so a
# JS-only PR got a full green board that meant nothing — #198 had to be checked
# by hand. The same blind spot is behind #170 and #177, where hook fixes shipped
# broken. See issue #202.
#
# Three details that decide how this is written:
#
# 1. The suite has two harness styles — five files use node:test and print
#    "ℹ pass N", four are hand-rolled and print "N/N tests passed". Parsing
#    either format would silently miss failures in the other, so this keys off
#    EXIT CODES only.
# 2. claude-hooks/tests/integration-test.js, phase2-integration-test.js,
#    test-code-execution.js and test-permission-request.js are deliberately
#    outside the *.test.js glob: they expect a live memory service. Do not widen
#    the glob to pull them in.
# 3. opencode/ is ESM and claude-hooks/ is CommonJS. node runs each file on its
#    own, so the two styles coexist without configuration - which is why one
#    runner can cover both.
#
# Env overrides (for tests):
#   MCS_HOOKS_TEST_DIRS space-separated directories to scan
#                       (default: "claude-hooks/tests opencode/tests")
#   MCS_HOOKS_TEST_DIR  a single directory, overriding the list above
#   MCS_NODE_BIN        node binary to use (default: node)
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 - every test file exited 0
#   1 - at least one file failed, or the runner could not run reliably

# Collect first, so an empty glob is an error rather than a silent pass. A rename
