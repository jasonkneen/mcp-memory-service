# scripts/pr/quality_gate.sh - Run all quality checks before PR review
#
# Two modes:
#   bash scripts/pr/quality_gate.sh --staged [--with-pyscn]      # staged changes (pre-PR)
#   bash scripts/pr/quality_gate.sh <PR_NUMBER> [--with-pyscn]   # a GitHub-era PR
#
# The staged mode is what pre_pr_check.sh calls; it needs no forge access.
#
# The complexity and security checks need a text model. By default they talk to a
# local OpenAI-compatible endpoint via scripts/pr/lib/llm_prompt.py, which keeps the
# gate off paid APIs. Set MCP_QUALITY_LLM=gemini to use the Gemini CLI instead.
# Endpoint configuration lives in that helper's docstring.
#
# Exit codes: 0 passed, 1 warnings, 2 critical (security), 3 skipped (no backend).
